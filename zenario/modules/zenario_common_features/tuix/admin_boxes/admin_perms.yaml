            #     - A <type>checkboxes</type> field to act as a list of permissions.
            #     - A <type>checkboxes</type> field with the <checking_child_checks_parents> tag set
            #       to act as a list of permissions with hierarchal dependencies.
            #     - A <type>checkbox</type> field immediately followed by a <type>checkboxes</type> field
            #       to act as a list of permissions that can be quickly turned on or off by the first
            #       checkbox. This will also add a toggle button to allow the longer list to be hidden.
