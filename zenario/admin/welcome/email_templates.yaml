            Your Admin Username:           [[USERNAME]]
            Your Temporary Admin Password: [[PASSWORD]]

            What to do now:

            1) Please follow this link to the Admin area of your site: [[URL]][[SUBDIRECTORY]]admin.

            2) Enter your Admin Username and Temporary Password.

            You can then continue administering your site in the normal way.

            Note that the above password is temporary and will be invalid if you do not log in within 24 hours.

            If you have not requested that the CMS send your Administrator details, please ignore this email and the temporary password, and log into your site in the normal way.
