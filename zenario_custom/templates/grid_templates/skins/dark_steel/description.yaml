# When extending a Skin, your Skin will inherit all of its css files.
# These css files from an inherited Skin will always be included before
# the css files in the current Skin, which allows you to customise or
# overwrite any rules from the inherited Skin.
# 
# It will also inherit anything in that Skin's description, with properties
# merging together using TUIX-like logic.

# A CSS class name or names. These will be added to a <div> that wraps the page.
# This might allow you to write rules in a component Skin that target specific
# Skins that extend it; for example your component Skin may wish to have rules
# that only apply to a right-to-left Skin.

# Pickable class names are class names that can be selected in certain places.
# In this case, where they have a Banner, an Admin will see a picker
# that lets them add e.g. the banner_with_image_floated_left class name to it.
# You can also have pickable class names for other Plugins,
# for Content Items, Layouts and Menu Nodes.
# If another Skin extends this Skin, then it will also inherit this list.
